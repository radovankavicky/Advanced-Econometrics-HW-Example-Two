Advanced-Econometrics-HW-Example-One
====================================

This repository contains the supporting files for an assignment I completed for a graduate level course in advanced econmetrics.  The assignment itself is the work of the course professor and teaching assistant.  All course identifying information has been removed from those documents, as well as from all other files below.  This repository contains:

1. HW3-Part-1.pdf the first part of the assignment
2. HW3-Part-2.pdf the second part of the assignment
3. Advanced-Econometrics-HW3.pdf is the main written submission
4. Advanced-Econometrics-HW3.tex is the LaTeX file that produces 3.
5. HW3Q3 is a MATLAB .m file that answers the final question produces the graphs on the last two pages of 1.
